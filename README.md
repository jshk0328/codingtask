# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Description
This repository contains Python code and a Jupyter notebook that analyzes the Titanic dataset (Titanic.csv).  The analysis focuses on understanding factors that influenced survival rates among passengers aboard the Titanic.

Understanding this dataset is crucial as it provides insights into historical events and helps in developing data analysis and visualization skills using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Installation
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
- cd <repository_directory>
3. Install the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) if not already installed:
- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
4. Download the Titanic.csv dataset and place it in the repository directory.

## Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies and placing Titanic.csv in the repository directory, run the Jupyter notebook (titanic.ipynb).  The notebook contains detailed analysis and visualisations of the dataset.

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the visualizations generated by the code:

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals several insights:
1. Gender had a significant influence on survival rates, with females showing a higher likelihood of survival.
2. Passenger class correlated with survival, with first-class passengers having higher survival rates compared to third-class passengers.
3. Age did not show a strong correlation with survival, though certain age groups (late teens to 30s) had higher survival rates.
4. Having a moderate number of family members aboard (e.g., one sibling/spouse) seemed beneficial for survival compared to traveling alone or with many family members.
5. For a detailed exploration of correlations and insights, refer to the Jupyter notebook (titanic.ipynb).
